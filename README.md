The ionosphere is part of the interface between a planetary body and the stellar (solar) wind.
Despite its name, in much of the Earth's ionosphere only a small fraction of the molecules are ionized.
I work to model, sense, and analyze:

* optical (infrared, visible, UV)
* radio (HF through UHF)
* magnetic field variation

I have well over 100 software projects I've created and maintain.
I have contributed to over 1,000 software projects, including major packages like the internals of CMake, Python, GNU Octave, LAPACK, MUMPS and many more.
