I wear a few different hats while I model the ionosphere of Earth and other planetary bodies.
The ionosphere might be thought of as an interface between a planetary body and the stellar (solar) wind.
Despite its name, through much of the Earth's ionosphere, only a small fraction of the molecules are ionized, but they make themselves known in many ways that I work to model, sense, and analyze:

* optical (infrared, visible, UV)
* radio (HF through UHF)
* magnetic field variation

I have well over 100 projects I've created and maintain, and have contributed to over 1,000 software projects, including major packages like the internals of CMake, Python, GNU Octave, LAPACK, MUMPS and many more.
The engineering courses I have helped create and lead gross over $2 million USD annually.
I co-invented and contributed to remote sensing and real-time embedded signal processing technology deployed in smart transportation systems with valuation of order $100 million USD.
I am an accredited angel investor and geospace scientist from one of the poorest parts of the USA, where "garbage day" was a chance to rescue, repair and sell discarded electronics from before age 12.

While my time is limited due to being PI on my own federally funded projects, I am setup for consulting if the fit is right, or I can help direct you to someone who can help.
