### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I wear a few different hats while I model the ionosphere of Earth and other planetary bodies.
The ionosphere might be thought of as an interface between a planetary body and the stellar (solar) wind.
Despite it's name, through much of the Earth's ionosphere, only a small fraction of the molecules are ionoized, but they make themselves known in many ways that I work to model, sense, and analyze:

* optical (infrared, visible, UV)
* radio (HF through UHF)
* magnetic field variation

I have well over 100 projects I've created and maintain, and have contributed to over 1,000 software projects, including major packages like the internals of CMake, Python, GNU Octave, LAPACK, MUMPS and many more.

While my time is limited due to being PI on my own federally funded projects, I am setup for consulting if the fit is right, or I can help direct you to someone who can help.
